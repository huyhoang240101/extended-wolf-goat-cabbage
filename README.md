# Extended wolf-goat-cabbage problem 
The shepherd must bring a wolf, a goat, a cabbage, a wooden stick and a fire torch on the other side of a river.
- Without the shepherd, if the wolf and the goat are together, the wolf eats the goat.
- Without the shepherd, if the goat and the cabbage are together, the goat eats the cabbage.
- Without the shepherd, if the stick and the wolf are together, the stick beats the wolf.
- Without the shepherd, if the stick and the torch are together, the torch burns the stick.
- The boat can transport 2 objects or animals across the river at each step.
